# riotjs: A React- like, 2.5K user interface library

Custom tags • Virtual DOM • Full stack • IE8

[Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) brings custom tags to all browsers
starting from IE8. Think React + Polymer, but squeezed into 2.5K.

With the `riot` package installed, `.tag` files in your application
are automatically compiled to JavaScript and the results are included
in the client JavaScript bundle.
