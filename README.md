# riotjs: A React- like, 2.5K user interface library

Custom tags • Virtual DOM • Full stack • IE8

[Riot](https://muut.com/riotjs/) brings custom tags to all browsers
starting from IE8. Think React + Polymer, but squeezed into 2.5K.

With the `riot` package installed, `.tag` files in your application
are automatically compiled to JavaScript and the results are included
in the client JavaScript bundle.

We do not include the browser compiler as we have a great way to have meteor
compile all on the server, if for some reason you feel this is a mistake,
please drop me a line and we'll chat about it.
